## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

I used an arbitrary value for the header text size which is something I have not explored before and it seems easy enough to use in future if I require it.

```html
<h1 class="text-[1.625rem]">Jessica Randall</h1>
```

### Useful resources

- [10 Tailwind Classes I Wish I Knew Earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1RJ5Q09PqM) - I learnt about the tailwind size utility class and was able to implement it in this project
